# Header

There are two types of headers: **app headers**, and **base headers**.

Adding `.appHeader` to the `<header>` tag so that it looks like `<header class="appHeader">` makes it 100% of the viewport's width all of the time. Removing the class will give the header a max-width of 1280px, more suitable for a website experience.
