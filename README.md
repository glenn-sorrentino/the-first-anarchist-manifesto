# The World's First Anarchist Manifesto
by Anselme Bellegarrigue, 23 March 1813

Originally copied from [The Anarchist Library](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anselme-bellegarrigue-the-world-s-first-anarchist-manifesto), I created this site to offer a more confortable reading experience for the manifesto.
